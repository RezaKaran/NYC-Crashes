## About
it seems that the dataset that we have is dirty, has a lot of missing values and can't be used by a machine learning model as it is. So I am going to make it readble by machine and also cleaning the unnecessary items and modify the dataset in a way to be ready for interpretation.

## Why
It is the first and basic thing to do before analysing

## When

I have started this project on Wednesday afternoon and the deadline is two days

## Usage

To install this project, you need to have Python3 and Pandas package
 
You will need a csv file named database.csv with ',' as seperator and data in this order:

  
 This project will clean errors, NaN value etc...So afterwards we will have a new dataset.
 
 ## Objective 
My objective is to clean and make the database in a way to be easier for the next level of getting information from it.
